<h1 align='center'>Foodie</h1>

## Introduction
Ever had an amazing food experience and thought, 'Let me jot this down in my notes'? Yeah, me neither. That's why I developed Foodie - because who wants their food adventures tucked away in some bland digital notebook? With Foodie, you can discover, share, and savour your food experiences with the flair they deserve. It's like having your own personal yelp in your pocket but shared with your friends (only if you want...). Keep reading for more details on Foodie and when it'll become available.

## Features
> Will be updated as the development of Foodie evolves.

## Deployment
At the start of the testing phase, the app will be available on [Test Flight]("https://testflight.apple.com"), a platform designed by Apple for this purpose.
> [!NOTE]  
> Foodie is built with Swift, SwiftUI, and Firebase. The app will only be available to iPhones running iOS 16 and higher since it takes advantage of many features not introduced prior to iOS 16.

## Timeline
I aim to have the app completed by the middle of summer 2024. This period will allow the app to enter the early stages of testing in the latter half of the year. Any updates pertaining to the status of this project will be communicated here.
